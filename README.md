# TDSpanoModeling

This algorithm fits time dependent UV-Vis absorbance data for blade-coated polymer films collected from a Ocean Optics QE Pro spectrometer to the Spano 
Model for H- aggregates. The workflow ultimately provides information regarding aggregation energetics and dynamics as a function of various processing 
conditions.

It comes with a GUI that allows one to quickly control the fit parameters as well as the loading and visualization of the time-resolved absorbance data.
